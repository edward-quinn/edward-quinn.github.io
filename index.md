# Welcome! My name is Edward Quinn and I am a fourth year PhD student in biological anthropology at the University of Florida. My research interest is in psychosocial stress and how it may affect gene regulation. I am involved in projects based in the U.S., Democratic Republic of Congo, and Jordan.
