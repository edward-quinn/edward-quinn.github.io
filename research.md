My dissertation involves work on three projects:

1. Health Equity Alliance of Tallahassee Heart Health Study

This is a community-based participatory research project investigating the causes of racial health inequalities in the African American community in Tallahassee, FL. Initial ethnographic research by Dr. Lance Gravlee revealed that many participants narrated their experiences of discrimination in terms of the experiences of close others, such as friends and family members. This vicarious exposure to discrimination is understudied. My role in this project has been to describe the social patterning of vicarious discrimination. A manuscript is currently in preparation for submission to *Social Science and Medicine*.

2. Epigenetics of Chronic and Violence-associated stress in the Democratic Republic of Congo

Working with collaborators at HEAL Africa Hospital in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, Dr. Connie Mulligan has undertaken research on this topic for over a decade. We are interested in how prenatal exposures to stress may impact the epigenome of newborn infants. My role in this project has been to conduct DNA extractions in the lab and the bioinformatic analyses of DNA methylation at over 850,000 locations in the genome per participant.

3. Intergenerational Effects of Stress Among Syrian Refugees

Working with collaboraters at Hashemite University, Yale University, and the University of Hawaii, Dr. Connie Mulligan has designed a study of the effects of direct, prenatal, and germline exposure to war-related stress. Similar to the project in Congo, my role here has been to analyze high dimensional datasets.
